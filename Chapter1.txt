Business Analytics (BA) is the practice of using quantitative data for decision making purposes.
This involves counting, rule-checking, and basic arithmetic.
Example: The newspaper organization Washington Postcan track readers by time, location and subscription information to learn how to suit their readers better in its display of advertisement.

Business Intelligence (BI) consists of manipulating data to visualize the bigger picture and reporting the past and present observations.
This involves creating charts, tables, and dashboards to display, examine and explore data.

Data mining refers to business analytics methods that uses statistical and machine-leraning methods for decision making.
Data mining go hand in hand with Big Data. 

Big Data has 4 challenges: 
1. Volume: amount of data.
2. Velocity: speed at which the data is genrated and changed.
3. Variety: different types of data being generated (currency, dataes, numbers, text, etc.)
4. Veracity: data is generated by organic distributed processes and not controlled in any way.


TERMINOLOGY
Algorithm A specific procedure used to implement a particular data mining technique: classification tree, discriminant analysis, and the like.
Attribute see Predictor.
Case see Observation.
Confidence A performance measure in association rules of the type “IF A and B are purchased, THEN C is also purchased.” Confidence is the conditional probability that C will be purchased IF A and B are purchased.
Confidence also has a broader meaning in statistics (confidence interval), concerning the degree of error in an estimate that results from selecting one sample as opposed to another.
Dependent Variable see Response.
Estimation see Prediction.
Feature see Predictor.
Holdout Data (or holdout set) A sample of data not used in fitting a model, but instead used to assess the performance of that model. This book uses the terms validation set and test set instead of holdout set.
Input Variable see Predictor.
Model An algorithm as applied to a dataset, complete with its settings (many of the algorithms have parameters that the user can adjust).
Observation The unit of analysis on which the measurements are taken (a customer, a transaction, etc.), also called instance, sample, example, case, record,
pattern, or row. In spreadsheets, each row typically represents a record; each column, a variable. Note that the use of the term “sample” here is different from its usual meaning in statistics, where it refers to a collection of observations.
