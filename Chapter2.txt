Core Ideas in Data Mining
  Classification: examine data with unknown classifcation and predict what the classification is.
  Prediction: predict the value of a numerical variable rather than a class.
  Association Rules and Recommendation Systems: find what goes with what
  
  Supervised Learning Algorithms: used in classfication and prediction.
    Training Data: the first sample of data from which the algorithm is trained about the relationship between predictor variables and outcome variable.
    Validation Data: the second sample of lableled data used to evaluate the trained algorithm.
    Test Data: the third sample that is used as a final evaluation of the model.
  Unsupervised Learning: used where there are no outcome variable to predict or classify.
    Examples: association rules, dimension reduction methods and clustering techniques.

Steps in Data Mining
